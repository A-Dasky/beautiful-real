# CS at castle King and Rasamus
text: king_M - Prince Rasamus. What is the urgent matter that you wish to discuss.
text: bard_M - I have received word that Chancellor Leeva and her advisors were disposed.
text: king_M - What!? Who would do...
text: bard_M - Prime Minister Tabone.
text: king_M - That doesn't make sense. He does not control {GENLAND1}'s army.
text: bard_M - He is also planning to overthrow President {LEEPPRESIDENT}.
text: king_M - This is madness. What gave Tabone the impression this was wise? I never figured him to be a fool.
text: bard_M - He had counsel.
text: king_M - Who in their right mind would suggest to risk the stability of the world? And for what?
text: king_M - Neither we nor {GENKINGDOM} will stand for this!
text: bard_M - Blind to the winds of change, as usual.
text: king_M - Excuse me?! And what do you know of change? You've lived a sheltered yet privlidged existance.
text: bard_M - Father, you hid behind these walls since the war. Each year you sent me out I hear from the people.
text: bard_M - "Thank you, Prince Rasamus." and "You're our hero, Prince Rasamus" and so on.
text: bard_M - The people have stopped asking for you hundreds of years ago. If it were not for me agreeing to relay their hopes they would not know you are still alive.
text: king_M - I refuse to tolerate this treason. Prince Rasamus you are hereby confined to your quarters until...
text: bard_M - Again, you are wrong father. These guards do not answer to you.
text: king_M - ...
text: bard_M - I train with them, I go with them on missions to the border. Their desire is my desire.
text: king_M - And what is that!
text: bard_M - Glory. You see Tabone will use {GENLAND1} and {GENLAND2} to wage war against {GENKINGDOM}.
text: bard_M - In the chaos I will secure {GENLAND1} then march on {GENLAND2}. 
text: king_M - You think you're the first Generational to seek power? You are a poor student of history.
text: bard_M - I will also secure the lost kingdom of {LOSTKINGDOM}. 
text: king_M - I was wrong, Tabone is not the fool. You are.
text: king_M - What do you expect to find there anyways?
text: bard_M - I expect to create a new line of Generationals. I have heard the tales and know what awaits me.
text: king_M - I was wrong, you're not a fool, you're mad! I cannot ...
text: bard_M - Enough of this.
# kill king
text: king_M - Gah!!!!!
# king fades
text: bard_M - We must secure the kingdom at once. Take care of my sister. Her presence may cause an uprising with those sympathetic with my father.
text: - Guard: At once, Your Majesty.
