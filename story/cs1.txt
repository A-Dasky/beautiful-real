text: ranger_M - You're finally up! We went by your place earlier but you were still sleeping.
text: monk_F - Not a care in the World.
text: ranger_M - Right. Not worried about today. You remembered what today is, right Kralean?
text: monk_F - He remembers.
text: warrior_M - Of course I remember Myhal. We have our Trial.
text: monk_F - Trial day! TRIAL DAY!
text: ranger_M - Not so loud Melhay.
text: monk_F - I'm just so... excited!
text: monk_F - Nervous!
text: monk_F - EXCITED!
text: warrior_M - Right. We need to talk to the elders before we start.
text: monk_F - Awww. Why do we need to talk to them?
text: ranger_M - Well for starters, tradition.
text: monk_F - But they always tell such long and boring stories.
text: ranger_M - There is value in those stories. Just need to listen carefully.
text: monk_F - You find your value, I'll be too busy finding a high grade Gem.
text: warrior_M - Good Luck. It has been hundreds of years since the last high grade Gem was mined here.
text: ranger_M - Right. We would be lucky to find a grade three.
text: ranger_M - Even if you found a grade three, I doubt you would know how to use it.
text: monk_F - I'd sell it to the highest bidder!
text: warrior_M - Ha. We'll see.
text: ranger_M - Right. Well, we better get going and meet up with the elders.
