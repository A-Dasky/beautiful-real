text: - Female Voice: Knight. I sense your guard is up. Why?
text: - Male Voice: Yes Princess. I must be on alert at all times.
text: - Female Voice: Is that so brave knight.
text: - Female Voice: Please call me Selell.
text: - Male Voice: Princess, you know I cannot.
text: - Princess Selell: What if I command it.
text: - Male Voice: I still dare not. King Tolen would send me to the front.
text: - Princess Selell: Haha. Yes he would, but lucky for you he has not returned to Addinral since before I was born. All I know of him are stories told of his glory.
text: - Princess Selell: As for you brave knight, what is your story?
text: - Male Voice: I was an orphan Princess. My parents stricken by the Sickness. I was raised on a small farm and sent to the Legion when I had grown.
text: - Princess Selell: I am sorry. I did not mean to bring forth painful memories.
text: - Princess Selell: Yet even with painful memories, your eyes are still soft. Oh brave knight.
text: - Male Voice: Forgive me Princess but...?
text: - Princess Selell: Oh brave knight, we have much to discuss. I refuse to be guarded by someone I do not know.
text: - Male Voice: What else would you like to know Princess?
text: - Princess Selell: I need to know what you cannot tell me. Oh my Brave Knight, this will be fun.
text: - Male Voice: Please forgive me I do not understand.
text: - Princess Selell: Relax brave knight. You need not worry.
text: - Princess Selell: But my name is Selell.
