text: princess_F - Where am I?
text: warrior_M - Who's there?
text: princess_F - Please do not hurt me. Where is everyone?
text: warrior_M - (That voice sounds familiar.)
text: warrior_M - I mean you no harm.
text: warrior_M - Princess Evlee?
text: princess_F - How did we get here? Where is everyone?
text: warrior_M - I do not know. And I don't know where here is.

text: soldier_M - Selell, why have we wandered so far from the protection of Castle Addinral?
text: princess_O - For this.
text: princess_O - As of late Addinral has grown deep in debt. The war efforts are costly and there seems to be no end in sight.
text: princess_O - Mother and I have had to increase taxes and requested additional crop yield. It seems not fair to the blacksmith and farmer and everyone between.
text: princess_O - Everyone has worked so hard already, and to push them even further I... I can't.
text: soldier_M - Selell.
text: princess_O - And even when we push them for more they do not hesitate. But they hurt. And I feel their pain.
text: princess_O - And that is why I came here.
text: princess_O - I am reminded of this world's beauty.
text: princess_O - My mind can rest and not think about the war.
text: princess_O - That way I can help make decisions that are best for the people of Addinral.
text: soldier_M - Your people know that this is not your war. Leepers emerged from Golisha. They brought this war to this land.
text: princess_O - My brave knight it is never that simple.
text: princess_O - Children younger than me have only known war. Young adults are being deprived a safe land to sow crops and raise a family.
text: princess_O - How can we ask them to support our war if we cannot provide for their basic needs.
text: soldier_M - Selell, I care for my fellow countrymen as much as any. We know these are hard times. We shall support you to defeat the Leepers.
text: princess_O - Oh my brave knight. We cannot just defeat our enemies, we must also preserve what makes our kingdom great.
text: soldier_M - King Tolen, Queen Margaret, Prince Rasamus, and you are the eternal lights our kingdom needs.
text: princess_O - Eternity. I know not what this means. I am no older than you. Even Rasamus had only reached our age before the war started.
text: soldier_M - Queen Margaret will teach you. She is wise and kind.
text: princess_O - What if... what if I did not want it.
text: soldier_M - Selell...
text: princess_O - I only know a world where the worst in us exists. The evils and horrors we are capable of.
text: princess_O - Maybe I wouldn't feel this way if... if everywhere were like here. Forgive me my brave knight, I know most do not get to see endless sunrises.
text: soldier_M - Thank you Selell.
text: princess_O - ...
text: soldier_M - You have shown me what love is.
text: soldier_M - Love is not measured in the number of sunrises, but rather the energy surrounding us when we experience love.
text: soldier_M - The world cannot forget this love, and neither can we.
text: princess_O - Oh my brave knight. Let's enjoy our peace while we can.
