# CS at castle King and Princess speaking
text: king_M - My dear Evlee. I'm glad you were able to meet our guests.
text: king_M - Please, tell me what you thought of them.
text: princess_F - Father, It is hard to cast judgement based on so little information.
text: king_M - Yes, you are correct. And we must not let that stop us from doing so. Oftentimes first impressions tell us what we do not wish to see later on.
text: princess_F - Well, Chancellor Leeva seems to weigh other's opinions before adding her own.
text: king_M - She has always held her opinions close. Very smart and calculating.
text: princess_F - Prime Minister Tabone reminds me of my brother.
text: king_M - Yes, he does. I believe you're sensing ambition. Both Rasamus and Tabone sought glory during the war, and I feel both fell short of reaching that when the war ended.
text: king_M - You must keep an eye on the ambitious ones.
text: princess_F - (Heh.)
text: princess_F - Even Rasamus?
text: king_M - Especially Rasamus.
text: princess_F - Oh, I um...
text: king_M - It is okay my dear. Just something to keep in mind.
text: princess_F - Yes, father.
text: princess_F - Oh, and the last guest, the advisor Calomere. He seems... sincere.
text: king_M - Yes, perhaps.
text: princess_F - Oh, did I misread his intentions?
text: king_M - Not quiet. Yes he does come across sincere, but also oddly patient.
text: king_M - Its rare to see in anyone, especially one not born like me, a Generational.
text: princess_F - Calomere is not a Generational?
text: king_M - There is no record of his birth in {GENKINGDOM}. All new Generational births were required to take place there, and were recorded.
text: king_M - It was a cause for celebration, and news was sent to every kingdom. But the last Generational birth occurred long before the war. 
text: princess_F - Then is he a Leeper?
text: king_M - No my dear. It was difficult to see his eyes behind his helmet, but it did not contain the Stain.
text: king_M - All leepers have the Stain. When light catches a Leeper's eye at the right moment you can see it.
text: king_M - The center of their eye flashes yellow, just for a split second. Leeva hid hers well.
text: king_M - And Tabone could care less who was made aware of this fact.
text: king_M - I rant. Forgive me my dear.
# Soldier comes to talk to King
text: - Guard: Forgive me Your Majesty. Prince Rasamus has requested counsel in the Throne Room at once.
text: king_M - Please inform Prince Rasamus I will arrive shortly.
text: - Guard: Yes, Your Majesty.
# Soldier exits
text: king_M - Hmmm.
text: princess_F - Father?
text: king_M - The timing is ... strange. Rasamus has sought me out in the past. A 'Where is he?' and occasional 'I need to speak to him.'. Those times did not come across ... planned. 
text: princess_F - I don't understand.
text: king_M - It is probably nothing. Just Rasamus upset after our guests left. He really does not like Leepers.
