text: berserk_M - Took you guys long enough. Figured you got lost and were crying in a ravine.
text: ranger_M - Heiral.
text: berserk_M - I see you're as charismatic as ever Myhal.
text: berserk_M - Whoa wait a second. Is that... A Gem? I've never seen anything like it.
text: monk_F - Finders keepers, Heiral. Bet you haven't even found a gem yet.
text: berserk_M - Haha. There's no need. I am just going to take that one off your hands. I know a few  people at Castle Addinral that would pay quite a bit of gold for such an odd Gem.
text: warrior_M - I don't think so. Get out of our way.
text: berserk_M - Hand over the Gem and I'll move.
text: warrior_M - I don't think so.
text: berserk_M - We'll see about that.
