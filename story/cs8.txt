text: ranger_M - Kralean, are you okay? You froze then asked where we are.
text: monk_F - You hearing things? Maybe you needed that extra sleep today...
text: warrior_M - No, I... Something odd just happened. I picked up this Gem and I heard voices, faint distant voices.
text: monk_F - Whoa. Strange. What were they saying?
text: warrior_M - I couldn't quite tell. Sounded like there was a struggle and people were in danger.
text: ranger_M - Hmmm. And this happened when you touched the gem?
text: warrior_M - Yeah. I picked it up and that's when it began.
text: ranger_M - Hmmm.
text: monk_F - Out with it already Myhal. What are you thinking?
text: ranger_M - ...
text: ranger_M - Well that's just it. I have never heard or read of something like this happening.
text: warrior_M - Maybe the village elders can help? We have our three Gems.
text: ranger_M - Right. Let's head back and see what they have to say.
