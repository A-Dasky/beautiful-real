text: - King Beausteau: I... I don't believe it.
text: - King Beausteau: Please, everyone stay until all parties have said what needs be saying.
text: princess_F - Oh... Please forgive forgive me King Beausteau. I do not know what happened.
text: - King Beausteau: It is okay, from what I observed you experienced a vision, due to the soul Gem.
text: - King Beausteau: Visitor from Addinral, what urgent news do you bring?
text: princess_F - King Beausteau, I am Princess Evlee of Addinral. Daughter of King Tolen.
text: - King Beausteau: I know King Tolen well, we have lived and fought wars together throughout many lifetimes.
text: princess_F - I am also the sister of Prince Rasamus.
text: - King Beausteau: I have met the young prince too, near the end of the war.
text: princess_F - It brings me great displeasure delivering this news. Prince Rasamus has deposed King Tolen and claimed the thrown of Addinral for himself.
text: - King Beausteau: That goes against the treaty ending the war. What madness possessed him to act?
text: princess_F - I am not certain, we hosted dignateries from {LEEPERKINGDOM} and {LEEPERKINGDOM2}.
text: - King Beausteau: Tabone... Once a snake...
text: princess_F - He was in attendance. 
text: - King Beausteau: How could Prince Rasamus align himself with a Leeper? What a fool.
text: captain_M - Pardon I, there be a problem.
text: - King Beausteau: Speak sailor.
text: captain_M - ( Eh.. Cap..) We slipped their waters fair enough, but there's no mistaken where we were headin and the wind.
text: princess_F - Rasamus wants me eliminated.
text: - King Beausteau: Of course. King Tolen was fair, and you represent that fairness and mortal. Rasamus power grab is everything people fear.
text: - King Beausteau: But we will not war with Addinral to put you on the thrown.
text: princess_F - I do not seek that.
text: - King Beausteau: I must be mistaken then... What urgent news do you bring.
text: captain_M - Addinral's fleet be preparin' for voyage. Only one place they be goin'.
# Boom
text: - Guard: Your Highness! A fleet is in the bay, preparing to invade. Their ships carry the Addinral flag!
