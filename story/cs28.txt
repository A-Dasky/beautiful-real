# CS at castle King, Princess, Bard on top
text: king_M - Good day. Let me be the first to officially welcome to you to Addinral.
text: king_M - Chancellor Leeva, Prime Minister Tabone.
text: king_M - I am joined today by my children His Royal Highness, Prince Rasamus, and by Her Royal Highness, Princess Evlee.
text: magician_F - King Tolen, it was kind of you to invite us to your home.
text: samari_M - It's been too long King Tolen. Last we met was ... Truce of the Three Kingdoms?
text: magician_F - Strange name considering there are four kingdoms...
text: samari_M - Maybe they think we'll forget about them?
text: king_M - Yes. The Truce of the Three Kingdoms was the last time the three of us were together. 
text: king_M - However, this time we are joined by others.
text: magician_F - Yes, forgive my manners. Let me introduce our advisor, Calomere.
text: king_M - It is a pleasure to meet you Calomere.
text: darkknight_M - The pleasure is all mine, King Tolen.
text: king_M - Now that formalities are out of the way let us proceed. I have called you here today to discuss your recent call to arms.
text: king_M - We do not know what sparked the increase in troops, and we kindly request to learn why.
text: magician_F - King Tolen, I assure you that whatever information you have received regarding the size and makeup of our army is incorrect.
text: magician_F - If anything our army has diminished in recent years. As your neighbor to the north both of our kingdoms benefit from mutual peace.
text: king_M - Yes. You are correct.
text: samari_M - I did not travel all this way to lie. We have increased our standing army. Our land is vast and mostly untamed.
text: samari_M - President {LEEPPRESIDENT} has requested more troops to defend our land from the beasts at our boarder.
text: bard_M - I believe it was tame prior to the Leeper War.
text: samari_M - You confuse oppression and tame, Prince Rasamus. Generationals that ruled Kavanso limited the use of any magic by it's inhabitants, and creatures.
text: samari_M - We require magic to flourish so that our inhabitants can live their fullest lives.
text: samari_M - A consequence is that magic returned to the creatures. We restored natural order.
text: bard_M - Order is the natural order. Untamed lands are chaos.
text: samari_M - That seems to be your opinion.
text: magician_F - Some find beauty in chaos, Prince Rasamus. 
text: bard_M - Let us table this philosophical discussion for our next visit.
text: king_M - Forgive my son, he is quick to remember the past.
text: magician_F - I can speak for all Leepers and say we too cannot forget the past. Everyday that goes by flowers grow, and bloom, and wither, and decay. But we remain the same.
text: king_M - Which is why we gather today. A future with peace and tomorrow's flowers and sunrises.
text: samari_M - What is your opinion Princess. Or are you allowed to have one?
text: bard_M - Her opinions are of no matter here.
text: samari_M - Last I recall commoner's opinions are what lead to conflict.
text: darkknight_M - We are off topic. Let us resume peace talks.
text: bard_M - Calomere, right? What exactly do you get from this?
text: darkknight_M - I serve to protect the peace.
text: bard_M - And not Leeva? How strange. Leeper or Generational?
text: darkknight_M - I am neither.
text: bard_M - An advisor that is neither? We do live in strange times. How did that come to be?
text: magician_F - Calomere is wise beyond his years.
text: bard_M - Or maybe the Leeper's were never that strong to begin with.
text: samari_M - Prince Rasamus, lest we forget the the Truce of the Three Kingdoms.
text: samari_M - Truce aren't the tool of the victors.
text: bard_M - I suppose but no one asked for my opinion on the matter.
text: king_M - We have strayed far off topic. There are a lot of questions for our travelers. Let us continue this discussion after supper.
